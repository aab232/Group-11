Bug reporting system:

The idea which our group has come up with for the bug reporting system is to include a bug report form in the help page of our website.

This form will be filled out by the user, expersing in which area/s of our website there may be a bug or a glitch.

This form will then be sent to a montiored email which will alert us as software developers to make any adjustments to our website so it's more user friendly.
